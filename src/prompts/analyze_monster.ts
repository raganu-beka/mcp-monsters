Follow this workflow exactly — do not skip steps or invent your own ordering:

**Step 1 — Profile.**
Call \`get_monster_details({ name: "${monster_name}" })\`. Read the response carefully.
Note the category, monster_type, habitat, rarity, and primary_power.

**Step 2 — Peers.**
Using the category from Step 1, call \`search_monsters_by_category({ category: "<category-from-step-1>", limit: 5 })\`.
This returns up to five peers in the same category.

**Step 3 — Matchup.**
Pick the most contrasting peer (different monster_type, or different habitat).
Call \`compare_monsters({ name_a: "${monster_name}", name_b: "<peer-name>" })\`.
Read the \`summary\` field of the response and the \`augments\`/\`hindrances\`
arrays for each combatant. The server returns the structured matchup data;
the verdict is yours to write — that's the point of the design.

**Step 4 — Output.**
Write your final answer in exactly these four sections, in this order, with these headings:

### Profile
A two-sentence summary of "${monster_name}". Include category, type, habitat, rarity.

### Affinities
List the monster's augments (strong against) and hindrances (weak against) from Step 1.

### Matchup
A one-sentence verdict ("X has the edge because…") based on the augments
and hindrances from Step 3. The server gave you the structured matchup;
the judgement is yours.

### Strategy
Two bullet points: one tactic that plays to "${monster_name}"'s strengths, one
tactic to watch out for in fights against it.

Do not add other sections. Do not write a preamble. Begin with the "### Profile" heading.`;
